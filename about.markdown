I am an IoT & Edge Systems Engineer based in Cologne, Germany, with a strong background in communication systems, LoRaWAN networks, and data-driven energy monitoring. I specialize in designing and operating end-to-end IoT infrastructures—from field devices and gateways to databases, dashboards, and system automation.

I hold degrees in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, and I am currently completing my MSc in Communication Systems and Networks at TH Köln. Professionally, I have worked on real-world deployments across campuses and industrial environments, integrating technologies such as LoRaWAN, BACnet, InfluxDB, Grafana, Docker, and Linux.

My focus is on reliable systems, clean architecture, and practical solutions. I value documentation, reproducibility, and continuous learning, and I am actively transitioning toward DevOps-oriented infrastructure roles alongside IoT engineering.
